Team Zoonii - QMUL MSc Bioinformatics
Kinase Kinpendium: Software Group Development Project
Kinase Kinpendium was developed by Team Zoonii â€“ a group of 3 students that are part of the MSc Bioinformatics Programme at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of Professor Conrad Bessant and Dr Fabrizio Smeraldi.

Kinase Kinpendium is a database that allows the user to explore kinase-substrate relationships, kinase-inhibitor relationships, and the neighboring genetic environment of phosphosites. Additionally, Kinase Kinpendium includes a data analysis tool that allows the user to upload experimental phosphoproteomics data and produces several visualisations to represent kinase activity.
